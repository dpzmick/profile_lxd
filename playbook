# frequency sweeps with different values of the CV

# held frequencies with different kinds of CV pulses generated
# some pulses may be close together, some far apart

# held value (max) of CV, on/off of the square wave

# can generate sound continuously or with some sort of envelope applied
# can generate freqency with envelope applied
# can set CV to a constant value
# can send envelope down CV

# each scene consists of
# 1) envelope for wave gen frequency
# 2) envelope for wave gen amplitude
# 3) envelope for CV out
# 4) duration of the scene (possibly derived from other paramaters)
